## Device installation scripts for Mac and Windows (WSL)

This is a reboot of my previous dotfiles repository as of January 2026. Between 2020 and 2025, I've messed around with many different settings across multiple devices and OSes. Meanwhile, the tooling has evolved a lot and AI is everywhere now. I've also learned some stuff. This is an attempt to keep track of my custom installations and configurations. The second motivation of this project is to keep learning, and experimenting with evolving *Nix based platforms and software, specially through scripting. Use this at your own risk!

The original repository was inspired by [Mathias Bynens' dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) repository and adapted from [Zell Liew's](https://github.com/zellwk/dotfiles) and from [Nick Janetakis's dotfiles](https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles.git). Although I copied many things, I also deleted/updated many things to suit my own needs and over time deviated significantly. I'd recommend using those as a reference.

For this reboot, I plan to keep mostly the same structure and relevant content as the previous repository, so nothing is lost, then remove the outdated tools and configuration, and go from there.

## Quickly Get Set Up with These Dotfiles

1. See the installation instructions for Mac and Linux: [setup.md](setup.md)

2. Create (your own) personal git configuration following the instructions [here](dotfiles/.config/git/git-configuration.md).
