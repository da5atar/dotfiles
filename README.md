# Device installation scripts for Mac and Windows (WSL)

This repository was inspired by [Mathias Bynens' dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) repository and adapted from [Zell Liew's](https://github.com/zellwk/dotfiles). 
Although I copied many things, I also deleted/updated many things to suit my custom installation. Use this at your own risk!

Here are the installation instructions for Mac and Windows (WSL)

- [Mac instructions](mac.md)
- [Windows (WSL) instructions](windows.md)
